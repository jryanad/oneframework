oneframework
============

###Work in progress

This is a framework developed specifically for use with AudiologyDesign client websites. The purpose of this framework is to
speed up development time while establishing universal standards across client sites.

###Whats included thus far

There are a number of _scss partials_ created that can be easily commented out if you shall choose not to inlcude them and
include your own, making everything interchangable.
