oneframework
============

###Work in progress

This is a framework developed specifically for use with AudiologyDesign client websites. The purpose of this framework is to
speed up development time while establishing universal standards across client sites.

###Whats included thus far

There are a number of _scss partials_ created that can be easily commented out if you shall choose not to inlcude them and
include your own, making everything interchangable.

###Getting Started

Currently configured with Npm and & Grunt task manager to compile, minify, and livereload the page. This is just for development only 
on the framework, to use the production version, use _master_.

You can install Node, Npm, and Grunt by following these instructions [here](http://thechangelog.com/install-node-js-with-homebrew-on-os-x/) 

To install dependencies, _cd_ to the _root_ directory and run _npm install_ and it will look through your _package.json_ file and install
the necessary dependencies.
